<h1>How to Make Hardware Page</h1>
<h2>Purpose of this page</h2>
<p>Now you know the basics of the computers and their functions you can now start coding and I will show you the steps I did in order to make this website specifically the Hardware Page.</p>
<p> Remember to consitantly save your work by clicking ctrl+s</p><h2> Hardware Page</h2> 
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>First for the Hardware Page I had to name the document howto.html by hitting ctrl s to save the file and it will tell you to name the file. This would tell your coding platform what code I will use for that file.<br> Also I added the base format for HTML files which consists of   < html > , < head > , < title > and < body > tags. Also makes sure you add <!DOCTYPE HTML> to define the document as well. Then I named my webpage in the < title > brackets. </p>
<p>The following pictures below show the code on c9 and how the website looks like</p>

<br>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p> Next for the hardware page I typed down the purpose for the page and that is really easy I titled it so I used a header and to do that you would type in < h1 > and the number inside of it tells you the size of the font of the header and 1 being the biggest font you can have. Then below the header I added some description of what I was going to talk about and I did this with the < p > or also known as the paragraph tag and this simply puts text in the spot you had the < p > tag. I added a < h3 > tag below the Hardware Page header that says step 1 to indicate what step I was talking about. Your coding platform might do this for you but you have to end your heading or pragraph tag with </ h1 > for headers or </ p > for paragraphs. I will just insert all the headings and paragraphs to make things simple.  </p>

<br>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>If you have a website with multiple pages you can add a navbar to have access to all of them. (this is all in the body tag) You can do this by add an < ul > or < ol > (unordered list or ordered list) and listing the other pages underneath using the < li > (list) tag and following that < li > tag is an < href > = "" and in the quotation marks you will link the file name of another webpage you have and that will create a navbar with a working link. make sure you end < href > and < li >with < /a > and </ li >. To make it look nice you would have to add css to the page and you make a new file and labeling with .css to tell your coding platform would code you will be using there and you would have to link your that file onto your html and you would do that by adding a < link > tag which is the start and then rel="stylesheet" will pop up and then will tell the platform what format you will be using. href="howto.css" is telling the platform what it is linking and type="text/css" tells the code what language it is using.</p>

<br>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Once you have linked your html file to your javascript you will now start making your page look better. First name what part of the page you are trying to make look better like the navbar itself would be #navbar in css or the navbar list which would be #navbar li. Once you labled the object on your website think about what you would want to change like the background or if you would like your text centered or a different color. (ex:background=blue; text-allign:center) Remember after the name of the object you are changing make sure you add { to opening up your changes and once you are done add a closing } to finish it off. </p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>To make things more organized and look better you can space out your writing using < br > and add pictures using < img></p>
