<h1>How to Make a Website</h1>
<h2>Purpose of this page</h2>
<p>Now you know the basics of the computers and their functions you can now start coding and I will show you the steps I did in order to make this website specifically the Hardware Page.</p>
<h2> Hardware Page</h2> 
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>First for the Hardware Page I had to name the document howto.html because it would tell c9 (the coding platform I'm using) what code I will use for that file. Also I added the base format for HTML files which consists of  <br> < html > , < head > , < title > and < body > tags. Also makes sure you add <!DOCTYPE HTML> to define the document as well. </p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p> Next for the hardware page I typed down the purpose for the page and that is really easy I titled it so I used a header and to do that you would type in < h1 > and the number inside of it tells you the size of the font of the header and 1 being the biggest font you can have. Then below the header I added some description of what I was going to talk about and I did this with the < p > or also known as the paragraph tag and this simply puts text in the spot you had the < p > tag. I added a < h3 > tag below the Hardware Page header that says step 1 to indicate what step I was talking about. Your coding platform might do this for you but you have to end your heading or pragraph tag with </ h1 > for headers or </ p > for paragraphs.  </p>
      
<h3>Step 3</h3>
