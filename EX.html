<h2>Meaning for this page</h2>
<p> This page covers the basics of computers and the coding it takes to design a simple webpage. To make a webpage you will first need to know how a computer works. You would need to know what components in possess and basic coding. 
        First you should know what a motherboard is, It is a printed circuit board which has the main components of a computer or other device. .</p>
     <h4 class=>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h4>
        <p>Another thing that is important to know is what the CPU is. It is the abbreviation for central processing unit and it basically is the brains of the computer. The CPU's history starts wtih the 8088 or eight eighty eight. The IBM (Internation Buiness Machines) decided to chose Intel's 8088 processor as the brain for the first computer. This made intel the main company in the CPU market and they continued to develop their CPUs even to present day.</p>
              
<h4>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h4>

        <p>Another key term would be RAM. RAM is the acronym for Random Access Memory and it is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly and it is the most common type of memory found in computers. Before RAM computers just relays, mechanical counters or delay lines for memory. The first form of RAM was the Williams Tube in 1947. The way it stored data was it used electronically charged spots on the face of a cathode ray tube to store the data and since the beam of the cathode ray tube could write and read spots in any order the memory was randomly accessed. Another type of RAM that was developed in 1947 was the Magnetic-Core Memory which became a widespread form of random-access memory and it stores memory relying on an array of magnetic rings. Magnetic-Core Memory kept developing until the mid 1970's.  </p>

<h4>Hard Drive</h4>

        <p>The hard drive of your computer is a high capacity, self-contained storage device on your computer. It basically retrieves and stores information you saved. The hard drive was created in 1950 to make the computer better by having more storage space. The commercial usage of hard drives began in 1956.</p>
                
<h4>Motherboard</h4>
<IMG HEIGHT="300" WIDTH="600" SRC="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiXpY-Ez7DQAhUD2GMKHTZJDagQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaltrends.com%2Fcomputing%2Fddr4-ram-specs-release-date-future-computer-memory%2F&psig=AFQjCNEIffC4ZLW_RItKDHYbifuu8VsUbA&ust=1479500505214622"> 
                    <p>The motherboard by itself is useless but it is needed for a computer to work.  It's main job is to hold the computer's microprocessor chip and let everything else connect to it. 
The shape and layout of a motherboard is called the form factor. The form factor affects where individual components go and the shape of the computer's case. These components included Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)-connections for video, sound and video capture cards, as well as network cards. Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) -  port for video cards. Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) - interfaces for the hard drives. Universal Serial Bus or FireWire - external peripherals and Memory slots </p>
                            
<h4>BUS/USB</h4>
<IMG HEIGHT="300" WIDTH="600" SRC="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiXpY-Ez7DQAhUD2GMKHTZJDagQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaltrends.com%2Fcomputing%2Fddr4-ram-specs-release-date-future-computer-memory%2F&psig=AFQjCNEIffC4ZLW_RItKDHYbifuu8VsUbA&ust=1479500505214622"> 
<p>The Universal Serial Bus or known as the USB was made in the 1990s and it is used to connect cables, connectors and communications protocols used in a bus for connection, communication, and it provides a power supply between computers and other electronic devices. It can be used to store extra information/memory space, external batteries, and connect different devices to your computer such as a mouse, speakers, chargers etc.</p>


<p>These components all make up your computer and they are important to understand for coding.
