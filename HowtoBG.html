    <center><h1> How to make the Inspirational Quote Button</h1></center>
    
    <h3>Step 1 (HTML)</h3>
    <IMG HEIGHT="50" WIDTH="700" SRC="bgpic1.PNG">
    <p>First make a button in html using  < button id="Name of variable">Button Name< /button>. This makes a button which will show up in your website it doesn't do anything at the moment its just there. Then we would make a div calling it whatever you want and this is were our randomized quote would appear when we click the button. Use < div id="">< /div> to make the div.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
       
    <h3>Step 2 (JavaScript)</h3>
    <IMG HEIGHT="20" WIDTH="700" SRC="bgpic2.PNG"> 
    <p>Once you have the button you then need to assign and you will do that in your javascript. Make a variable with the same name as the variable in the button function. <br> To define variables use var "Name of Variable" = document.getElementById("Name of Variable");.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
`      
    <h3>Step 3 (JavaScript)</h3>
     <IMG HEIGHT="125" WIDTH="700" SRC="bgpic3.PNG">  
    <p>Then find 3 or more quotes so it would randomize, it doesn't matter how many quotes you have and how long they are. Make a variable and name it whatever you want and then put an equal sign after the name of you variable <br> and following that a [. This is where you would put your quotes. Separate each quote with , and have "" around each quote.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
  
    <h3>Step 4 (JavaScript)</h3>
    <IMG HEIGHT="100" WIDTH="700" SRC="bgpic4.PNG">  
    <p>Now you have your quotes and your button. Next step is to make the button work because we have all the tools and we just have to bring them together now. we would make a function naming whatever we want and then we would make a variable randomNumber and making it equal to Math.random which is the function that randomizes our quotes. Then you would mention the length of the quote and the div you made.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
   
    <h3>Step 5 (JavaScript)</h3>
    <IMG HEIGHT="30" WIDTH="700" SRC="bgpic5.PNG">  
    <p>Once you have that we have to make our button work and we do that by adding an add.EventListener. For this project we would write name of button.addEventListener("click", name of function);     <br> This tells the code whenever you click on the button it will do what the function tells them to do.</p>
